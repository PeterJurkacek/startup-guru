## How Can Humans Create the AI capable of interpreting an X-ray image?
### Through **Data Science**

---

## 1. Define the Task
Define the AI's task: interpreting tooth decay from X-ray images.
## 2. Design Exercises
Create **X-ray images dataset** with and without decay for AI training.
*Input: "X-ray image"*
*Output: "Tooth decay is present"*
## 3. Evaluate Success
Compare AI responses to correct answers to assess accuracy.

## How Can Humans Create a AI like a ChatGPT?
### Through **Data Science**

---

## 1. Define the Task
Define the chatbot's task: engaging in conversation and providing meaningful responses.
## 2. Design Exercises
Generate a diverse **dataset** of conversational examples for AI training
*Prompt: "How was your day?"*
*Response: "Good, yours?"*
## 3 Evaluate Success
Assess AI model performance for effective conversation.

## How Can Humans Create AI to Rule the World?
### Disclaimer: **Don't do that**

---

## 1. Define the Task
Clearly outline the AI's task: to achieve total control over the world
## 2. Design Exercises
Develop a series of strategic challenges for the AI to overcome in its pursuit of domination.
## 3. Evaluate Success
Evaluate the AI's success in executing domination plans and maintaining control.
