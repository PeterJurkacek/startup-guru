# How Do We Create Artificial Intelligence?

---

## 1. Defining a Complex Task
* Learn to interpret tooth decay from X-ray images
## 2. Exercise Design:
* Prepare a series of 100 X-ray images, some containing teeth with or without decay, and the AI will attempt to assess whether decay is present or not
## 3. Evaluating Success
* Compare AI responses with correct answers

# How Do We Create a Chatbot?

---

## 1. Defining a Complex Task
* Learn to respond to user input sentences
## 2. Exercise Design
* Prepare 1000 sentences, omitting some words, and require the Artificial Intelligence to complete them
## 3. Evaluating Success
* Evaluate whether the words filled in by the AI match those we removed

## Defining a Complex Task:
* Teach a student to interpret tooth decay from X-ray images
## Exercise Design:
* Prepare a series of 100 X-ray images, some containing teeth with or without decay, and the student will attempt to assess whether decay is present or not
## Evaluating Success:
* Compare the student's responses with the correct answers and calculate their accuracy
