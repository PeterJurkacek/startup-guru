### **Human Intelligence** in dentistry?
# Dental professional intelligence
1. Take X-ray
2. Interpret X-ray
3. Make decision

## Creating students' intelligence?

<div class="columns"><div>

# Profesor's perspective
* Task: I would like to teach my **students** how to classify tooth decay from dental x-ray image
* Excercise: I have to design excercise for them
* Evaluation: I have to evaluate their performance

</div><div>

# Student's perspective
* Task: I would like to know how to classify tooth decay from dental x-ray image
* Excercise: I have to do excercise (e.g. interpret at least 100 x-ray with tooth decay)
* Evaluation: If scored above 90% I am prepared

</div></div>

# Let's create better intelligence together

1) We will get to know each other
2) We will go trought our excersices in x-ray interpretation compare yourself with our experts
3) AI will go trought our excersices
4) We will see comparision between you and our AI
