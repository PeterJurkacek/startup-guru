### **Human Intelligence** in Dentistry?
# Dental Professional Intelligence
1. Take X-ray
2. Interpret X-ray
3. Make decisions

## Creating Students' Intelligence

<div class="columns"><div>

# Professor's Perspective
* Task: I would like to teach my **students** how to classify tooth decay from dental X-ray images
* Exercise: I have to design exercises for them
* Evaluation: I have to evaluate their performance

</div><div>

# Student's Perspective
* Task: I would like to know how to classify tooth decay from dental X-ray images
* Exercise: I have to do exercises (e.g., interpret at least 100 X-rays with tooth decay)
* Evaluation: If scored above 90%, I am prepared

# Let's Create Better Intelligence Together

1) We will get to know each other
2) We will go through our exercises in X-ray interpretation, compare yourself with our experts
3) AI will go through our exercises
4) We will see a comparison between you and our AI
